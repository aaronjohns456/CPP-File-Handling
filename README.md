# C++ File-Handling Practical

Q1) Make a c++ program which can dynamically read, append and write to csv files.

Q2) Given two CSV files: student.csv and student_bucketing.csv, write a program to merge them into a single file using student_id as the common column for joining the tables. Ensure that repetitive columns are removed. Additionally, perform the following tasks:
- Count the number of students who achieved a first-class grade.
- Count the number of students who are employed.
- Identify the youngest student who is employed.
- Print information about students who scored a second-class grade and are employed.
